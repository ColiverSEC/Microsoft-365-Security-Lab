# Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Lab

This project showcases a hands-on lab where I configured and tested **Microsoft Purview's Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** capabilities. The process began by creating and publishing **Sensitivity Labels** to classify sensitive data such as PHI and PII. Then, I created, deployed, and validated a DLP policy that protects this sensitive data within Microsoft 365, with alerts surfaced across **Purview**, **Defender for Cloud Apps**, and **audit logs**.

---

## üîç Lab Objectives
- Create and publish **Sensitivity Labels** to classify sensitive information like Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  
- Deploy a **DLP policy** to detect and protect sensitive data types in outbound email using these labels.  
- Validate policy enforcement with a real-world test scenario.  
- Review resulting **alerts**, **audit logs**, and **label classifications**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
- Microsoft Purview Compliance Portal  
- Microsoft Defender Portal  
- Microsoft 365 Admin Center  
- Exchange Online (Mail Flow)

## üìÇ Full Workflow Walkthrough

See the [full DLP policy creation and testing walkthrough](docs/dlp-walkthrough.md) for step-by-step screenshots and instructions, including:  
- Creating and publishing Sensitivity Labels  
- Creating a DLP policy  
- Configuring DLP rules  
- Sending a test email  
- Reviewing alerts in Purview and Defender  
- Verifying audit logs

---

## üîë Key Takeaways
- Sensitivity labels enable consistent classification and protection of sensitive data.  
- DLP policies in Microsoft 365 can detect and block sensitive data in transit based on labels and content.  
- Alerts integrate seamlessly with Purview and Defender for Cloud Apps.  
- Audit logs provide traceability of policy actions.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Expand testing to SharePoint and OneDrive data loss prevention.  
- Automate policy deployment with Microsoft Graph or PowerShell.  
- Integrate additional sensitivity labels and auto-labeling policies.
