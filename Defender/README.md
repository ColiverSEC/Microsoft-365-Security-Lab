# ‚òÅÔ∏è Microsoft 365 Security Lab: Cloud Discovery with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back to Microsoft 365 Security & Compliance Lab Overview](../README.md)

## üîç Focus Area: Shadow IT Discovery & App Risk Analysis

This lab demonstrates how to use **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDCA)** to discover unsanctioned applications (Shadow IT) in an environment by ingesting network traffic through firewall logs.

---

## ‚úÖ Objectives

- Upload network traffic logs into Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
- Generate a **Cloud Discovery Snapshot Report**
- Analyze discovered apps and review risk scores
- Demonstrate visibility into Shadow IT and cloud app usage

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to Cloud Discovery

- From the left menu, select **Cloud Discovery ‚Üí Snapshot reports**.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Snapshot Report

- Click **‚ûï Create snapshot report**
- Name the report (example: `Lab W3C Discovery Test`)
- Under **Data source**, select:  
   **Generic W3C Log**
- Upload the sample W3C log file created for this lab.  
   *(File contains simulated cloud app traffic such as Dropbox and Slack)*

---

## üîç Key Findings

- Shadow IT apps such as Dropbox, Slack, and Google Drive were detected.
- MDCA assigned risk scores to each app based on security posture and compliance.
- Admins can now **sanction** or **unsanction** apps and set up **governance policies**.

---

## üí° What This Demonstrates

- Hands-on creation of a Cloud Discovery snapshot
- Ingestion and parsing of W3C log files
- Shadow IT discovery capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
- App risk management and SaaS visibility

---

## üìÇ Next Steps

- Integrate Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for **continuous cloud app discovery**
- Configure **App Governance policies** and OAuth app controls
- Explore automated alerting on risky SaaS usage
