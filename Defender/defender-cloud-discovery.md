# ‚òÅÔ∏è Microsoft 365 Security Lab: Cloud Discovery with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

[‚¨ÖÔ∏è Back to Microsoft 365 Security & Compliance Lab Overview](../README.md)

This lab demonstrates hands-on experience with **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDCA)** for Shadow IT discovery and cloud app risk analysis. The lab guides you through uploading firewall logs, generating Cloud Discovery snapshot reports, analyzing discovered apps, and understanding app risk scores.

---

## üîç Lab Objectives

- Upload network traffic logs into MDCA  
- Generate a **Cloud Discovery Snapshot Report**  
- Analyze discovered apps and review risk scores  
- Understand Shadow IT exposure and take action to govern cloud apps

### Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Create a Snapshot Report

- Go to **Cloud Discovery ‚Üí Snapshot reports**  
- Click **+ Create snapshot report**  
- Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `Sample Lab W3C Log`)  
- Under **Data source**, select **Generic W3C Log**  
- Click **Upload file** and select your `sample-w3c.log`  
- Click **Create** to start processing

### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Monitor Report Processing

- The report will show as **Processing**  
- Wait 1‚Äì3 minutes for processing to complete  
- Refresh the page until the status shows **Completed**

### Step 4Ô∏è‚É£: Review Discovered Apps

- Navigate to **Cloud Discovery ‚Üí Discovered apps**  
- Examine the list of apps from the snapshot log (e.g., Dropbox, Slack, Google Drive)  
- Click an app to view:
  - App category and description  
  - Usage statistics  
  - Security **risk score**

### Step 5Ô∏è‚É£: Interpret and Take Action

- Review **risk scores** to prioritize apps for governance  
- Decide which apps to **Sanction** or **Unsanction** based on company policy  
- Optionally create governance policies to monitor or restrict risky apps  
- Use insights to inform cloud security strategy and Shadow IT management  

---

## üìä Key Findings

- Shadow IT apps such as Dropbox, Slack, and Google Drive were detected  
- MDCA assigned **risk scores** to each app based on security posture and compliance  
- Admins can now **sanction** or **unsanction** apps and configure governance policies  

---

## üí° What This Demonstrates

- Hands-on creation of a Cloud Discovery snapshot  
- Ingestion and parsing of W3C firewall log files  
- Shadow IT discovery capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps  
- Cloud app risk management and governance fundamentals  

---

## üìÇ Next Steps

- Integrate **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** for continuous cloud app discovery  
- Configure **App Governance policies** and OAuth app controls  
- Explore automated alerting on risky SaaS usage
